# Webpack Single Page Boilerplate

A boilerplate for a single page app using [webpack][webpack_link]

# Why should I use it

So far, this is the best way I found to build files like `index.html` into
[webpack][webpack_link]. This boilerplate handles Javascript, CSS and HTML
bundling using only [webpack][webpack_link].

# Usage

The general directory structure is:

```
├── assets/
│   └── image
│       └── favicon.png
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── environment.json
├── plugins/
│   └── html-plugin.js
├── README.md
├── scripts/
│   └── index.js
├── styles/
│   └── index.less
└── webpack.config.js
```

- Your javascript entry point is `scripts/index.js`
- Your style entry point is `styles/index.less`
- 'environment.json' file provides optional environment variable settings,
  but you can delete it if you don't need it.
- The `plugins/html-plugin.js` file is better explained on the *About* section,
  with the `html-parser-plugin` plugin.

There's a hack to build HTML files, replacing the `src` and `href` tags related
to images into their corresponding file in `dist` directory. This way, a
`index.html` file that looks like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample App</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <link href="!assets/image/favicon.png" rel="icon"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Becomes this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Sample App</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <link href="84eafba88857e5fd2e85d63beaf3fb31.png" rel="icon">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Notice that the `favicon.png` file was replaced with
`84eafba88857e5fd2e85d63beaf3fb31.png`. This happened because the favicon.png
file link was marked with a `!` prepending it - it tells the plugin that the
url should be bundled and replaced.

# About

This boilerplate includes the following loaders:

  - `babel-loader`: Enable ES6 features.
  - `file-loader`: Call `require` for binary files.
  - `img-loader`: Optimize image compression.
  - `json-loader`: Call `require` for `json` files.
  - `less-loader`: Style your pages with [less](http://lesscss.org/).
  - `style-loader`: Add exports of a module as style to DOM.

It also includes the following plugins:

  - `extract-text-webpack-plugin`: Extract css text from bundled styles.
  - `html-parser-plugin`: Custom experimental plugin to enable html parsing
                          on webpack. It is used to emit a `index.html` file
                          along with it's images.
